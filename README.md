Welcome to my little project app called The Wishlist!! As you may expect, it is an app for setting aside money to buy the things you want. I currently flavor it to be a video game app but you can save it for anything!!

The App has 2 main screens. The first one allows you to set the money you want to spend that month on items of your choice (currently flavored to video games). It also allows you to set the name of the Item you currently want to most
(Note: The app is currently still in development. Right now it functions on good faith, as there is nothing stopping you from spending over what you set aside. ) The second main screen allows for API access, and display items in a FlatList

I'm currently using basic components from ReactNative, which are things like AsyncStorage, useState, useEffect. I also make use of Navigation to allow switching between screens.
